["DATA PROCESS SHAPE Brainstorming session 7 June 2019 ","Introduction to Data Process Shape • Data Process shape is an Execute Shape in Dell Boomi Platform (ie: It can manipulate document data). • Data process shape mainly used for manipulating document data within a process from splitting and combining to Zipping and Unzipping. ","Base64 Encode & Decode • Base64 is group of Binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in ASCII string format by transmitting it into a radix-64 representation. • It is used to encode arbitrary octet sequences into a form that satisfies the rules of 7bit. Designed to be efficient for non-text 8 bit and binary data. Sometimes used for text data that frequently uses non-US-ASCII characters. ","Character Encoding & Decoding • Character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of characters by a particular type of encoding system. • Available encoding system are: • UTF-8 • UTF-16BE • UTF-16LE • UTF-16 • ISO-8859-1 • US-ASCII ","Combine Document • Combines multiple documents into a single document. • Each document's data is simply appended to the previous document's data. • Type of Combine Document: • Flat File • XML • JSON • None Split Document • Splits a document into multiple documents by line or based on a profile element value. • Type of Split: • Flat File • XML • JSON • EDI ","Map JSON to Multipart Form Data MIME • Converts an input JSON document containing simple form data and file attachments into a multipart/form-data MIME document. Sample JSON data Sample Multpart Form Data MIME Map Multipart Form Data MIME to JSON • Converts an input multipart/form-data MIME document into a single JSON output document by mapping simple data and attachment files into JSON objects. • Both simple data form elements and attachment files of the input MIME document are referenced directly in the JSON output document using a type element to differentiate them. Sample JSON data Sample Multpart Form Data MIME ","Zipping • Allows you to zip incoming data that is in the WinZip compression format. • The incoming data is zipped and the documents are passed through the Data Process shape into the process. Unzipping • Allows you to unzip incoming data that is in the WinZip compression format. • The incoming data is unzipped and the documents are passed through the Data Process shape into the process. ","PGP Encrypt • Allows you to encrypt a file based on the desired security setting and certificate. PGP Decrypt • Allows you to decrypt a file based on the defined certificates. ","Custom Script • Provides the ability to use custom scripting to perform special processing requirements. You can access and modify the actual document data and tracked properties using JavaScript or Groovy. • A custom script can be inserted inline as part of the processing step. If you prefer, you can reference a Process Scripting component that is available for reuse. Either way, there is no need to compile because the script is ready to execute when you save the process. ","Search/Replace • Allows us to use regular expressions to search the document for specific strings or characters defined in the search text box. • Once the data is located it will be replaced with the string or characters defined in the replace text box.
